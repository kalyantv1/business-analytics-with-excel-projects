# Business Analytics with Excel – Project Portfolio

This repository showcases three applied projects completed as part of Johns Hopkins University's **“Business Analytics with Excel: Elementary to Advanced”** specialization on Coursera. Together, they demonstrate skills in optimization modeling, resource allocation, and time-series analysis using Microsoft Excel.

## Project 1 – Bluejay Natural Gas: Capital Budgeting Optimization

- Goal: Select the best portfolio of 12 possible energy projects over three years to maximize total NPV under annual and total capital budget limits.  
- Approach: Built an Excel optimization model with binary decision variables, budget constraints, and functional-area coverage requirements; used Solver to maximize total project value.  
- Outcomes: Identified an 8‑project portfolio that delivers over \$2.1B in value, uses about 98.5% of available capital, and satisfies all budget and department constraints.  
- Skills: Excel (SUMIF, COUNTIF, IF), integer linear programming concepts, Solver configuration, capital budgeting, business communication.

## Project 2 – Bluejay Natural Gas: Advanced Manager Assignment & Portfolio Optimization

- Goal: Extend the basic capital budgeting model by adding manager assignment and tighter budget conditions to create a more realistic staffing‑constrained optimization problem.  
- Approach: Added a manager–project qualification matrix, binary assignment variables, workload limits per manager, and new constraints so each approved project gets exactly one qualified manager.  
- Outcomes: Produced a 9‑project portfolio with higher total value while ensuring all staffing, budget, and coverage rules are satisfied and no manager is overloaded.  
- Skills: Multi-variable optimization, matrix-based constraints, advanced Solver setups, trade-off and scenario analysis, portfolio interpretation.

## Project 3 – Microsoft Sales Trend Analysis (1992–2011)

- Goal: Analyze 20 years of Microsoft sales data to identify growth patterns, key business periods, and the impact of macro events like the 2008 financial crisis.  
- Approach: Organized data in Excel; calculated year-over-year growth, total growth, and CAGR; segmented the timeline into growth phases and created charts to visualize trends.  
- Outcomes: Showed 132% total growth over two decades, higher growth in early years, slowing as markets matured, and a clear dip during 2008–2009 with recovery afterward.  
- Skills: Time-series analysis, growth metrics (YoY, CAGR), data visualization, business interpretation, and explaining trends to non-technical audiences.

## Skills gained from these projects

Across all three projects, these are the core skills developed and demonstrated:

- Excel analytics: Multi-sheet model design, structured tables, advanced formulas (SUMIF, COUNTIF, IF, logical checks), and clear labeling for maintainable workbooks.  
- Optimization modeling: Formulating capital budgeting and manager assignment problems, translating business rules into constraints, configuring Excel Solver with binary variables, and validating optimal solutions.  
- Data analysis & time-series: Calculating year-over-year growth, total growth, and CAGR; segmenting time periods; identifying trends, inflection points, and anomalies in historical sales data.  
- Business analytics & decision-making: Connecting quantitative results to business decisions (project selection, staffing, investment timing), analyzing trade-offs under budget and capacity limits, and explaining “why this solution makes sense” in plain language.  
- Communication & documentation: Creating portfolio-ready reports, teaching-style explanations for non-technical audiences, clear charts and tables, and interview-ready STAR stories based on real analytical work.
